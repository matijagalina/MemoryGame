## Instructions

Goal of the game is to match every tile.
There are no time limits, but the timer will go on until you finish it.
More moves you make the lower star rating will be at the end.
The match is confirmed when two open tiles share the same sign and their background turns green.
At the end the modal window will appear and show how much time did you need to win, how many stars did you win
and it will offer you a chance to play again.

## Contributing
